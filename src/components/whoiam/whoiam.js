I love coding because solving problems and seeing ideas come to life on the page is supremely satisfying. I geek out on higher order functions, finding and learning awesome libraries or frameworks, and getting front and back ends to play nicely.</span>

I am a lifelong learner and my current learning projects (beyond code!) include piano and writing my first book.</span>
